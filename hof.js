// #1: Use the `map` array method to create a new array containing the names of each
// person in the `people` array. Assign the returned array to a variable
// called `peopleNames`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var peopleNames=people.map(element=>element.name);


// #2: Use the `filter` array method to create a new, filtered array containing only
// persons from the `people` array who know multiple languages. Assign the returned array
// to a variable called `polyglotPeople`.
// Type your solution immediately below this line:
var polyglotPeople = people.filter(element=>element.knownLanguages>1)
